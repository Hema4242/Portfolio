        <h1>1.Home automation using Arduino Uno and Bluetooth</h1>
        <p>Home automation using Arduino Uno and Bluetooth is a smart system that enables users 
        to control electrical appliances remotely via a smartphone. The project utilizes an Arduino 
        Uno microcontroller, an HC-05 or HC-06 Bluetooth module, and relay modules to switch appliances
         onand off. Users send commands through a mobile application, which are received by the Bluetooth 
         moduleand processed by the Arduino to control the connected devices.  

        This system offers convenience, energy efficiency, and enhanced security, reducing manual effort
        and enabling automation. Features such as voice control, scheduling, and sensor-based automation 
        can be added to improve functionality. The project is cost-effective, beginner-friendly, and a great
        introduction to IoT and embedded systems.</p>

        <p>The restaurant interface menu is a user-friendly digital display that showcases a variety of food 
            items along with their respective costs. It is designed for easy navigation, allowing customers to
             browse different categories such as appetizers, main courses, desserts, and beverages. Each item 
             is listed with a brief description, price, and sometimes an image to enhance the dining experience.
              The interface may include filters for vegetarian, non-vegetarian, or special dietary preferences.
               Additionally, it can support customization options for meal preferences and portion sizes.
                A seamless ordering system ensures a smooth and convenient experience for customers, enhancing
                 overall satisfaction.</p>
